BUG REPORT for TEST CASE 1

March 24, 2023

Description:
The App increments the "Losses" score, everytime you play a round, whether you win or lose and keeps the "Wins" score as 0.

Steps to Reproduce: 
1. Click the link: http://localhost:4000 to navigate to the Duel Duo website. 

2. Click the button that says "draw" and when five bot options appear, select two of the bots and click the buttons underneath them titled, "Add to Duo."

3. Click the button titled, "Duel!" 

Click the button titled, "Play Again" and repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have won a round.

Expected Results:

-The page should display "Wins:" with an integer score of how many times you have played and won and "Losses:" with an integer score of how many times you have played and lossed. The "Wins" integer should increment by one each time you win and the "Losses" score should increment by one each time you lose.

Actual Results:

The page maintains "Wins: 0" and increments the integer after "Losses" by one, everytime you play, whether you win or lose.

Environment:

-Version 110.0.5481.177 (Official Build) (arm64)
-MacOs Ventura 13.1
